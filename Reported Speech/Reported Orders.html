<p>Finally, how about if someone doesn't ask so politely? We can call this an 'order' in English, when someone tells you very directly to do something. For example:

</p><ul>
<li><font color="Purple">Direct speech: </font>"Sit down!"</li>
</ul>

<p></p><p>In fact, we make this into reported speech in the same way as a request. We just use 'tell' instead of 'ask':

</p><ul>
<li><font color="Purple">Reported speech: </font>She told me to sit down.</li>
</ul>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th><strong>Direct Order</strong></th>
<th><strong>Reported Order</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Go to bed!”</td>
<td>He told the child to go to bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Don’t worry!”</td>
<td>He told her not to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Be on time!”</td>
<td>He told me to be on time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Don’t smoke!”</td>
<td>He told us not to smoke.</td>
</tr>
