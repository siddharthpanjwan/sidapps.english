There is one very simple rule about prepositions. And, unlike most rules, this rule has no exceptions.
</p><font align="center"><font color="Purple" >Rule</font></b></font>
<br>A preposition is followed by a "noun". It is never followed by a verb.
<br align="center"><font >By "noun" we include:</font>
<ol><li>noun (dog, money, love) </li>
<li>proper noun (name) (Bangkok, Mary) </il>
<li>pronoun (you, him, us) </li>
<li>noun group (my first job) </li>
<li>gerund (swimming) </li></ol>
<p align="justify">A preposition cannot be followed by a verb. If we want to follow a preposition by a verb, we must use the "-ing" form which is really a gerund or verb in noun form.
In the following sentences, why is "to" followed by a verb? That should be impossible, according to the above rule:
<br>I would like to go now. 
<br>She used to smoke. 
Here are some examples:

<br><b>Answer to Quick Quiz:</b> In these sentences, "to" is<b> not </b>a preposition. It is part of the <b>infinitive</b><br> ("to go", "to smoke").
