<p>Now imagine that the same stranger walks into your room and says:<br>
<li>I teach. </li>
<li>People eat. </li>
<li>The Earth rotates. </li></p><br>
Do you understand something? Has this person communicated something to you? Probably yes! <br>Not a lot, but something. That's because these verbs are main verbs and have meaning on their own. They tell us something. Of course, there are thousands of main verbs.
In the following table we see example sentences with helping verbs and main verbs. <br><br><font color="Purple" >Notice that all of these sentences have a main verb. Only some of them have a helping verb.</font><p>
<table  border="1">

<br>Helping verbs and main verbs can be further sub-divided, as we shall see on the following pages.
<br>Forms of Main Verbs
<br>Main verbs (except the verb "be") have only 4, 5 or 6 forms. "Be" has 9 forms.

The infinitive can be with or without to. For example, to sing and sing are both infinitives. We often call the infinitive without to the "bare infinitive".s</td></tr></table></p>

<br>At school, students usually learn by heart the base, past simple and past participle (sometimes called V1, V2, V3, meaning Verb 1, Verb 2, Verb 3) for the <br>irregular verbs. They may spend many hours chanting: sing, sang, sung; go, went, gone; have, had, had; etc. <br>They do not learn these for the regular verbs <br>because the past simple and past participle are always the same: they are formed by adding "-ed" to the base. They do not learn the present participle and 3rd person singular present simple by heart—for another very simple reason: they never change. <br>The present participle is always made by adding "-ing" to the base, and the 3rd person singular present simple is always made by adding "s" to the base (though there are some variations in spelling).
<br><b>*</b> Note that "do", "have" and "be" also function as helping or auxiliary verbs, with exactly the same forms (except that as helping verbs they are never in infinitive form).<b>
