<p>The type of sentence is determined by the number and type of clauses it contains. It
				falls into one of the following:</p>
<font  color="Purple">Simple sentence </font> 

<p>A simple sentence conveys a single idea. It has only one subject and one
				verb.<br>
EXAMPLE: She is my girlfriend. /
				I am bored. / That is a fat monkey.<br>The verb in each sentence
				is in bold.</P>
<font  color="Purple">Complex Sentence </font> 
<p>A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. The independent clause is called the main
				clause, and the dependent clause is called the subordinate
				clause. These clauses are joined by conjunctions which include:
				as, as if, even if, if, because, unless, etc.<br>
EXAMPLE: As she is a big bully, I
				stay away from her. / I will do it if I have the time.<br>The
				main clauses are in bold; the subordinate clauses are not.</p>

<font  color="Purple">Compound Sentence </font> 
<p>compound sentence is composed of at least two clauses or
				sentences joined together by a conjunction, i.e. words like: and,
				but, for, nor, or, so, therefore, either ... or, neither ... nor,
				not only ... but also, etc., or punctuated by a semi-colon. A
				compound sentence consists of at least two Independent or Main
				Clauses and verbs. The subordinate or dependent clause may or may
				not be present in a compound sentence. It is possible for a
				compound sentence to have three, four or more independent
				clauses. But commonly, it contains only two clauses.<br>
EXAMPLE:I am skinny and you are
				obese. (Two main clauses joined by a conjunction.)<br>EXAMPLE: I
				know what you know. (Main clause: I know; subordinate clause:
				what you know)<br>EXAMPLE: I always tell you what I know but you
				never tell me what you know.<br>The last example shows a sentence
				with two main clauses and two subordinate clauses.</p>


<font  color="Purple">Compound-complex Sentence</font> 
<p>A compound-complex sentence has at least two independent clauses
				and at least one dependent clause.</p>
