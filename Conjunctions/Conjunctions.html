A conjunction is a word that "joins". A conjunction joins two parts of a sentence.
<p><font color="Purple" >Here are some example conjunctions:</font></p>
<table  border="1">
<tr>
<th>
Coordinating Conjunctions</th>
<th> Subordinating Conjunctions</th></tr><tr>
<td tyle="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat" >and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so</td>
<td tyle="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat" >although, because, since, unless</td></tr></table>

<br>We can consider conjunctions from three aspects.
<p><b><font color="Purple" >Form</font></b></p>
Conjunctions have three basic forms:
<li>Single Word</li>
for example: and, but, because, although
<li>Compound (often ending with as or that)</li>
for example: provided that, as long as, in order that
<li>Correlative (surrounding an adverb or adjective)</li>
for example: so...that 
<br><br><b><font color="Purple" >Function</font></b><p>
Conjunctions have two basic functions or "jobs":
<li><p><b>Coordinating conjunctions</b> are used to join two parts of a sentence that are grammatically equal. The two parts may be single words or clauses, for example:
<br>- Jack and Jill went up the hill.
<br>- The water was warm, but I didn't go swimming.</p></li>
<li><b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> are used to join a subordinate dependent clause to a main clause, for example:
<br>- I went swimming although it was cold. </p></li>
<b><font color="Purple" >Position</font></b><p>
<li>Coordinating conjunctions</li> always come between the words or clauses that they join.
<li>Subordinating conjunctions</li> </p>
