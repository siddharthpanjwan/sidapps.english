<p>There are two special forms for verbs called <b>voice</b>:</p>
<ol><li><b><font size="3" color="Purple">Active voice</font></b></li><li><b><font size="3" color="Purple">Passive voice</font></b></li></ol>
<p>The <b>active voice</b> is the "normal" voice. This is the voice that we use most of the time.A feature of sentences in which the subject performs the action of the verb and the direct object is the goal or the recipient.</p>

<p>In passive sentences, the thing receiving the action is the subject of the sentence and the thing doing the action is optionally included near the end of the sentence. You can use the passive form if you think that the thing receiving the action is more important or should be emphasized. You can also use the passive form if you do not know who is doing the action or if you do not want to mention who is doing the action.</p>
