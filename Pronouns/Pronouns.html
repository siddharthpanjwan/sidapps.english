<p align="justify">Pronouns are small words that take the place of a noun. We can use a pronoun instead of a noun. Pronouns are words like:
 <b>he, you, ours, themselves, some, each...</b> If we didn't have pronouns, we would have to repeat a lot of nouns. We would have to say things like: 
</p><ul><li>Do you like the president? I don't like the president. The president is too pompous. </li></ul>
<p>With pronouns, we can say:</p>
<ul><li>Do you like the president? I don't like him. He is too pompous.</li> </ul>
