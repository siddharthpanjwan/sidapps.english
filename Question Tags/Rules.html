Here are some rules to follow:
<p>
    <b>1.QUESTION TAG </b>= <font  color="Red">AUXILIARY</font> + <font  color="blue">PERSONAL PRONOUN:</font></p>
    <p>Tony can run really fast, <font  color="Red">can't </font> <font  color="blue">he?</font></p>
    <p>The twins are very nice, <font  color="Red">aren't </font> <font  color="blue">they?</font></p>
    <b><p>2.</b>If there is <b>no auxiliary</b> in the statement, use a form of <b>do</b> in the question tag:</p>
    <p>Mum cooks fantastic meals,<font  color="Red"> doesn't</font> she?</p>
    <b><p>3. Positive</b> statements => <b>Negative</b> question tags;</p>
    <p><b>Negative</b> statements => <b>Positive</b> question tags:</p>
    <p>That's your workbook, isn't it?</p>
    <p>That's not true, is it?</p>
    <p>They will help us, won't they?</p>
    <b><p>4. Orders and commands</b> are followed by <b>"will you"</b>:</p>
    <p>Don't open the windows, <b>will you</b>?</p>
    <p>Help your dad in the garage, <b>will you</b>?</p>
    <b><p>5. Let's</b> is followed by <b>"shall we"</b>:</p>
    <p>Let's start homework now, <b>shall we</b>?</p>
    <p>Let's go shopping, <b>shall we</b>?</p>
    <b><p>6. AND DON'T FORGET</b>:</p>
        <p>The question tag "am I not" is totally incorrect; always say: "aren't I":</p>
        <p>I am late, <b>aren't I?</b></p>
        <p>The statements and the question tags take the <b>same tenses</b>:</p>
        <p>Bob helped you a lot, didn't he?</p>
        <p>You will help me tomorrow, won't you?</p>
