<p align="left">We use "had better" plus the infinitive without "to"&nbsp; to give advice. Although "had" is the past form of "have", we use "had better" to give advice about the present or future. </p>
<ul>
  <li>You'd better tell her everything. </li>
  <li>I'd better get back to work. </li>
  <li>We'd better meet early. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The negative form is "had better not". </p>
<ul>
  <li>You'd better not say anything. </li>
  <li>I'd better not come. </li>
  <li>We'd better not miss the start of his presentation. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">We use "had better" to give advice about specific situations, not general ones. If you want to talk about general situations, you must use "should". </p>
<ul>
  <li>You should brush your teeth before you go to bed. </li>
  <li>I shouldn't listen to negative people. </li>
  <li>He should dress more appropriately for the office. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When we give advice about specific situations, it is also possible to use "should". </p>
<ul>
  <li>You shouldn't say anything. </li>
  <li>I should get back to work. </li>
  <li>We should meet early. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">However, when we use "had better" there is a suggestion that if the advice is not followed, that something bad will happen. </p>
<ul>
  <li>You'd better do what I say or else you will get into trouble. </li>
  <li>I'd better get back to work or my boss will be angry with me. </li>
  <li>We'd better get to the airport by five or else we may miss the flight. </li>
</ul>
