<p align="left"><strong><em>Used to do </em></strong></p>
<p align="left">We use '<font color="purple">used to</font>' for something that happened regularly in the past but no longer happens. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I <font color="purple">used to</font> smoke a packet a day but I stopped two years ago. </li>
  <li>Ben <font color="purple">used to</font> travel a lot in his job but now, since his promotion, he doesn't. </li>
  <li>I <font color="purple">used to</font> drive to work but now I take the bus. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>There <font color="purple">used to</font> be a cinema in the town but now there isn't. </li>
  <li>She <font color="purple">used to</font> have really long hair but she's had it all cut off. </li>
  <li>I didn't use to like him but now I do. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">'Used to do' is different from 'to be <font color="purple">used to</font> doing' and 'to get <font color="purple">used to</font> doing' </p>
<p align="left">to be <font color="purple">used to</font> doing </p>
<p align="left">We use 'to be <font color="purple">used to</font> doing' to say that something is normal, not unusual. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm <font color="purple">used to</font> living on my own. I've done it for quite a long time. </li>
  <li>Hans has lived in England for over a year so he is <font color="purple">used to</font> driving on the left now. </li>
  <li>They've always lived in hot countries so they aren't <font color="purple">used to</font> the cold weather here. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">to get <font color="purple">used to</font> doing </p>
<p align="left">We use 'to get <font color="purple">used to</font> doing' to talk about the process of something becoming normal for us. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I didn't understand the accent when I first moved here but I quickly got <font color="purple">used to</font> it. </li>
  <li>She has started working nights and is still getting <font color="purple">used to</font> sleeping during the day. </li>
  <li>I have always lived in the country but now I'm beginning to get <font color="purple">used to</font> living in the city. </li>
