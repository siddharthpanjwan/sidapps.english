<p>We can make a <strong>zero conditional </strong>sentence with two present simple verbs (one in the 'if clause' and one in the 'main clause'): </p>
<ul>
  <li>If + present simple, .... present simple. </li>
</ul>
This conditional is used when the result will always happen. So, if water reaches 100 degrees, it always boils. It's a fact. I'm talking in general, not about one particular situation. The result of the 'if clause' is always the main cluase.
<p>The 'if' in this conditional can usually be replaced by 'when' without changing the meaning. </p>
<p>For example: If water reaches 100 degrees, it boils . (It is always true, there can't be a different result sometimes). If I eat peanuts, I am sick. (This is true only for me, maybe, not for everyone, but it's still true that I'm sick every time I eat peanuts) </p>
Here are some more examples:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><ul>
        <li>If people eat too much, they get fat. </li>
        <li>If you touch a fire, you get burned. </li>
        <li>People die if they don't eat . </li>
        <li>You get water if you mix hydrogen and oxygen. </li>
        <li>Snakes bite if they are scared </li>
        <li>If babies are hungry, they cry </li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>
