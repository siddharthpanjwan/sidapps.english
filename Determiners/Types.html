   <h3>Types  of determiners</h3>
    
<h4><font color="Purple" >Articles </font></h4>
       
         <p> The definite and indefinite articles are all determiners.</p>

         <ul>
           <li>Definite article - <strong><em>the</em> </strong></li>
           <li>Indefinite article - <strong><em>a</em></strong> or <strong><em>an</em> </strong>(<strong><em>a</em></strong> is used before a consonant sound; <strong><em>an</em></strong> is used before a vowel sound.) </li>

         </ul>
                
           <p>Close <strong><em>the</em></strong> door, please.<br>
           I've got <strong><em>a</em></strong> friend in Canada.  </p>
           <h4><font color="Purple" >Demonstratives</font></h4>
      
         <p>There are four demonstrative determiners in English and they are: <strong>this, that, these and those</strong></p>

         <p>Note that demonstrative determiners can also be used as  demonstrative pronouns. When they are used as determiners they are  followed by the nouns they modify. Compare:</p>
       
           <p><strong><em>This</em></strong> is my camera. (Demonstrative used as a pronoun, subject of the verb <em>is</em>) <br>
             <strong><em>This</em></strong> camera is mine. (Demonstrative used as a determiner modifying the noun <em>camera</em>.) </p>
    <h4><font color="Purple" >Possessives</font></h4>
      
         <p>Possessive adjectives<strong> - my, your, his, her, its, our, your, their -</strong> modify the noun following it in order to show possession.</p>
         <p> Possessive determiners are different from possessive pronouns - <strong>mine, his, hers, yours, ours, their.</strong> </p>

         <ul>
           <li>Possessive pronouns can stand alone and are not followed by  nouns. </li>
           <li>Possessive determiners, on the other hand, are followed by nouns.</li>
          </ul>
         <p><font color="Purple" >Compare:</font></p>
        
           <p>This is <strong><em>my</em></strong> house.  (<strong><em>my</em></strong> is a possessive determiner. It is followed by the noun <em>house</em> which it modifies)<br>

             Is that car <em><strong>yours</strong></em>? (<em><strong>yours</strong></em> is a possessive pronoun. It is not followed by a noun.)           </p>
    <h4><font color="Purple" >Quantifiers</font></h4>
      

         <p>Quantifiers are followed by nouns which they modify. Examples of quantifiers include:</p>
        
           <p>some, any, few, little, more, much, many, each, every,  both, all, enough, half, little, whole, less etc.</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Quantifiers   are commonly used before either countable or uncountable nouns.</p>
        

           <p>He knows <strong><em>more</em></strong> people than his wife.<br>
             <strong><em>Little</em></strong> knowledge is a dangerous thing
             .</p>
            <h4><font color="Purple" > Numerals</font></h4>
            <p>Numbers are cardinal (one, two, three, etc) and ordinal (first, second, third, etc). 
            Cardinal numbers are adjectives that indicate quantity (There are five apples on the table), 
            and ordinal numbers indicate rank or order (This is the first time for me on a plane).
         </p>
         <p>There are <strong><em>five </em></strong>apples on the table</p>
         <h4><font color="Purple" >Distributives</font></h4>
         <p>The words all, both, half, each, every, either and neither are known as distributives.<br>
         <p> <strong><em> All</em></strong> my life I have been waiting for this moment.<br>
       <strong><em>Both</em></strong>  the dogs have passed away.<br>
         <strong><em>Half</em></strong>  the village perished in the floods.</p>
