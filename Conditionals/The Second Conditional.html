<p>The <strong>second conditional</strong> uses the past simple after if, then 'would' and the infinitive: </p>
<ul>
  <li>if + past simple, ...would + infinitive </li>
</ul>
<p>(We can use 'were' instead of 'was' with 'I' and 'he/she/it'. This is mostly done in formal writing). </p>
<p>It has two uses. </p>
<p>First, we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true. Maybe I'm imagining some dream for example. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.(I probably won't win the lottery) </li>
  <li>If I met the Queen of England, I would say hello. </li>
  <li>She would travel all over the world if she were rich. </li>
  <li>She would pass the exam if she ever studied .(She never studies, so this won't happen) </li>
</ul>
<p>Second, we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible, because it's not true. Is that clear? Have a look at the examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If I had his number, I would call him. (I don't have his number now, so it's impossible for me to call him). </li>
  <li>If I were you, I wouldn't go out with that man. </li>
</ul>
How is this different from the first conditional?
<p>This kind of conditional sentence is different from the first conditional because this is a lot more unlikely. <br>
    <br>
  For example (second conditional): If I had enough money I would buy a house with twenty bedrooms and a swimming pool (I'm probably not going to have this much money, it's just a dream, not very real) <br>
  <br>
  But (first conditional): If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes (It's much more likely that'll have enough money to buy some shoes) </p>
