<p>The short, simple conjunctions are called <font color="Purple" >"coordinating conjunctions":</font>
<br> and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so 
<br> A coordinating conjunction joins parts of a sentence (for example words or independent clauses) that are grammatically equal or similar. A coordinating <br>conjunction shows that the elements it joins are similar in importance and structure:
 </p>
<p><font color="Purple" >Look at these examples</font> <br>- the two elements that the coordinating conjunction joins are shown in square brackets [ ]:
<br>I like [tea] and [coffee]. 
<br>[Ram likes tea], but [Anthony likes coffee]. </p>
Coordinating conjunctions always come between the words or clauses that they join.
When a coordinating conjunction joins independent clauses, it is always correct to place a comma before the conjunction:
I want to work as an interpreter in the future, so I am studying Russian at university. 
However, if the independent clauses are short and well-balanced, a comma is not really essential:
<br>She is kind so she helps people. </p>
<p>When "and" is used with the last word of a list, a comma is optional:
<br>He drinks beer, whisky, wine, and rum. 
<br>He drinks beer, whisky, wine and rum.</p> <p>
<p>The 7 coordinating conjunctions are short, simple words. They have only two or three letters. There's an easy way to remember them - their initials spell: 
</p>F-For
<br>A-And
<br>N-Nor
<br>B-But
<br>O-Or
<br>Y-Yet
<br>S-So
