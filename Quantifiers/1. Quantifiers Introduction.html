<p>Quantifiers form a sub-class under determiners. They are adjectives or phrases that serve to answer two possible questions:&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many? </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;How much?&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example: a few, a little, much, many, most, some, any, enough,&nbsp;etc., are quantifiers. </p>
<p>Quantifiers that describe quantity </p>
<p>Words and phrases that describe quantity include&nbsp;a little, none, a few,&nbsp;etc. Some of these are used only with: </p>
<p>&nbsp;Countable nouns - These are the nouns &nbsp;that answer the question&nbsp;How many? For example: a few, a number of, several,&nbsp;etc. </p>
<p>Uncountable nouns - These are the nouns that answer the question&nbsp;How much? For example: &nbsp; a little, a bit of,&nbsp;etc.) </p>
