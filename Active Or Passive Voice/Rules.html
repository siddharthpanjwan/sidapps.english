<p>Take care of singular and plural nature of nouns or pronouns. Verb/helping verb requires
to be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Interrogative sentences beginning with ‘wh’ words like what, why, when etc. thequestion word is retained in the beginning of the sentence. An interrogative sentence in theactive voice remains an interrogative in the passive form.
An imperative sentence is a sentence showing order, or request. So, accordingly, in the passive voice, we say: You are requested/ordered/advised + infinive with ‘to’.</p>
<p>Sentences involving order/advice are preferably changed into passive by using the word‘let’ or ‘should’. Please close the door. You are requested to close the door. Save your soul. Your soul should be saved. Let your soul be saved. Do it. Let it be done. It should be done.
In some sentence the subject is understood type. Here the subject has to be suppliedaccording to the context while changing them into active form. The thief was arrested. (by the police.)</p>
<p>Preoposition attached with the verbs in the active form continue to be attached with themeven in the passive form. Please listen to him. You are requested to listen to him. He turneddown my proposal. My proposal was tuned down by him.k 
In the case of a verb having two objects in Active Voice, either of them can be retained inthe passive. Hari gave me an apple. I was given an apple by Hari. An apple was given to me byHari.</p>
<p>Intransitive verbs do not have passive forms. I go to school. Go is intransitive verb. Sono passive form.
What is done, cannot be undone. What people do, they cannot undo.</p>
<p>Quasi Passive Verbs: The rose smells sweet. The rose is sweet when smelt. Quinine tastes bitter. Quinine is bitter when tasted. Lemons taste sour. Lemons are sour when tasted.</p>
<p>With some verbs, preposition ‘by’ is not used. Like know (to), surprise (at), annoy (with),contain (in), vex (with), please (with), displease (at), alarm (at), line (with), throng (with)</p>
