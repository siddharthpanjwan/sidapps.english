<p><font color="Purple"><b><i>Idioms</i></b></font>  combination of words that has a figurative meaning .Meaning Of Idioms cannot be understood by refering an english dictionary.</p>
<p>For example, " easygoing "An English dictionary would explain that "easy " means simple, not difficult ", and that " going " means traveling from one place to another. Thus you could literally translate easygoing as meaning the path from one place to another is not complicated or physically far, by adding together these dictionary meanings.

Idiomatically, we mean that such a person's personality is warm, friendly, pleasant, and helpful.</p>

Meaning: Easy, simple to do, no difficulties.
