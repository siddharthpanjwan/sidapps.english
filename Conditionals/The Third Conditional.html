<p>We make the <strong>third conditional</strong> by using the past perfect after 'if' and then 'would have' and the past participle in the second part of the sentence: </p>
<ul>
  <li>if + past perfect, ...would + have + past participle </li>
</ul>
<p>It talks about the past. It's used to describe a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If she had studied , she would have passed the exam (but, really we know she didn't study and so she didn't pass) </li>
  <li>If I hadn't eaten so much, I wouldn't have felt sick (but I did eat a lot, and so I did feel sick). </li>
  <li>If we had taken a taxi, we wouldn't have missed the plane </li>
  <li>She wouldn't have been tired if she had gone to bed earlier </li>
  <li>She would have become a teacher if she had gone to university </li>
  <li>He would have been on time for the interview if he had left the house at nine </li>
</ul>
