<p><strong><font color="Purple">Time Expressions with Reported Speech</font></strong><br><br>

Sometimes when we change direct speech into reported speech we have to change time expressions too. We don't always have to do this, however. It depends on when we heard the direct speech and when we say the reported speech.<br><br>

For example:<br><br>

It's Monday. Julie says "I'm leaving <strong>today</strong>".<br><br>

If I tell someone on Monday, I say "Julie said she was leaving <font color="Purple">today</font>".<br>
If I tell someone on Tuesday, I say "Julie said she was leaving <font color="Purple">yesterday</font>".<br>
If I tell someone on Wednesday, I say "Julie said she was leaving <font color="Purple">on Monday</font>".<br>
If I tell someone a month later, I say "Julie said she was leaving <font color="Purple">that day</font>".<br><br>

So, there's no easy conversion. You really have to think about when the direct speech was said.<br><br>

Here's a table of some possible conversions:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>now</td><td>then / at that time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>today</td><td>yesterday / that day / Tuesday / the 27th of June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>yesterday</td><td>the day before yesterday / the day before / Wednesday / the 5th of December</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>last night</td><td>the night before, Thursday night</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>last week</td><td>the week before / the previous week</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tomorrow</td><td>today / the next day / the following day / Friday</td>
</tr></table>
