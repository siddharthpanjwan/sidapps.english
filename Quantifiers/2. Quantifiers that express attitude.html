<p>The words&nbsp;few, little&nbsp;and the phrases - a few&nbsp;and&nbsp;a little&nbsp;serve to describe the speaker's attitude to the quantity being described. The first two carry negative suggestions, whereas the last two carry positive suggestions. For e.g.: </p>
<p>&nbsp;The phrase&nbsp; I have little time&nbsp; means that the speaker hardly has time, whereas the phrase&nbsp; I have a little time &nbsp;means that while the speaker may not have all the time in the world, but s/he has enough for the purpose at hand. </p>
<p>'Enough' </p>
<p>Enough&nbsp;is used to indicate the necessary amount or quantity; it is placed before nouns. For e.g.:&nbsp;There is enough time, You have enough money, Is there enough food?, etc. </p>
