<p align="justify">There are about 150 prepositions in English. Yet this is a very small number when you think of the thousands of other 
words (nouns, verbs etc). Prepositions are important words. We use individual prepositions more frequently than other
 individual words. In fact, the prepositions of, to and in are among the ten most frequent words in English.
  Here is a short list of 70 of the more common one-word prepositions. Many of these prepositions 
  have more than one meaning. Please refer to a dictionary for precise meaning and usage.</p>
