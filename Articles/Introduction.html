<p>The 3 <b><font  color="Purple">articles </font></b>in English are<b><font  color="Purple"> a, an </font></b> and <b><font  color="Purple">the</font></b>. The learner has to decide noun-by-noun
which one of the articles to use.</p>
<p>The word<font  color="Purple"> a</font> (which becomes <font  color="Purple">an</font> when the next word begins with a vowel - a, e, i, o, u) is called the indefinite article because the noun it goes with is indefinite or general.  The meaning of the article a is similar to the number one, but one is stronger and gives more emphasis.  It is possible to say I have a book or I have one book, but the second sententence emphasizes that I do not have two or three or some other number of books.</p>
<p>The word <font  color="Purple">the</font> is known as the definite article and indicates a specific thing. The difference between the sentences I sat on a chair and I sat on the chair is that the second sentence refers to a particular, specific chair, not just any chair.</p>
<p>Many nouns, especially singular forms of countable nouns must have an article. In English, it is not possible to say I sat on chair without an article, but  a demonstrative or possessive adjective can be used instead of an article as in the sentences I sat on that chair and I sat on his chair. </p>
