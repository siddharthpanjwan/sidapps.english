<p>A question tag is a special construction in English. It is a statement followed by a mini-question. The whole sentence is a <b>"tag question"</b>, and the mini-question at the end is called a <b>"question tag".</b></p>

<p>We use  <b>tags</b>  in spoken English but not in formal written English.

They are not really questions but are a way of asking the other person to make a comment and so keep the conversation open.</p>
<p>
Making a tag is very mechanical. To make a tag, use the first auxiliary. If there is no auxiliary, use do, does or did. With a positive sentence, make a negative tag and with a negative sentence, make a positive tag..</p>
<p>The basic structure is:</p>

<table border="1"align="center"
	>
<tr align="center">
<th>Statement</th><th>Question Tag</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><center>+</br>
Positive statement,</td><td><center>-</br>
negative tag?</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>Snow <font  color="Red">is</font> white,</td><td><font  color="Red">isn't</font> it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><center>-</br>
Negative statement,</td><td><center>+</br>
positive tag?</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>You  <font  color="Red">don't</font>  like me,</td><td><font  color="Red">do </font> you?</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We use tag questions at the end of statements to ask for confirmation. They mean something like: "Am I right?" or "Do you agree?" They are very common in English.</p>
<p>Notice that the question tag repeats the auxiliary verb (or main verb when be) from the statement and changes it to negative or positive.</p>
