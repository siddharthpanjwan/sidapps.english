<p align="justify">In English grammar, words that refer to people, places, or things are called nouns. They can be classified in many ways.
</p>
<p align="justify">One way to classify nouns is according to whether they can be counted or not. Many English mistakes are related to this point. By reading through this page, you will understand:

what countable and uncountable nouns are
<br>how to use them correctly in a sentence<p>
<font color="Purple">Countable (or count)</font>nouns are words which can be counted. They have a singular form and a plural form. They usually refer to things. Most countable nouns become plural by adding an ‘s’ at the end of the word.
</p>
For example:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>chair</td>
<td>chairs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bottle</td>
<td>bottles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>student</td>
<td>students</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p align="justify"><font color="Purple">Uncountable (or non-count)</font>nouns are words which cannot be counted. Therefore, they only have a singular form. They have no plural forms. These words are thought of as wholes rather than as parts. They usually refer to abstractions (such as confidence or advice) or collectives (such as equipment or luggage).</p>
For example:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Singular</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>money</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>furniture</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>information</td>

</tr>
</table>
