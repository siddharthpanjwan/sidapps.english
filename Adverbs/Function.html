<p align="justify">The principal job of an adverb is to modify (give more information about) verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.
 In the following examples, the adverb is in bold and the word that it modifies is in italics.
</p><p><font color="Purple" >Modify a verb:</font></p>
- John speaks loudly. (How does John speak?) <br>
- Mary lives locally. (Where does Mary live?) <br>
- She never smokes. (When does she smoke?) 
<p><font color="Purple" >Modify an adjective:</font></p>
- He is really handsome.
<p><font color="Purple" >Modify another adverb:</font></p>
- She drives incredibly slowly.
But adverbs have other functions, too. They can:
<p><font color="Purple" >Modify a whole sentence:</font></p>
- Obviously, I can't know everything.
<p><font color="Purple" >Modify a prepositional phrase:</font></p>
- It's immediately inside the door.

<br><br>·       Certainly,the thief chose the wrong profession.</p>
