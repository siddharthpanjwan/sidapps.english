<p>* doesn’t change</p>


<p>Occasionally, we don’t need to change the present tense into the past if the information in direct speech is still true (but this is only for things which are general facts, and even then usually we like to change the tense):

</p><ul>
<li>Direct speech: “The sky is blue”</li>	
<li>Reported speech: She said that the sky <strong>is/was</strong> blue</li>
</ul>
