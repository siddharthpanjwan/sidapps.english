<p><em><strong>Adverbs of certainty</strong></em> express how certain or sure we feel about an action or event. </p>
<h3>Usage </h3>
<p>Common adverbs of certainty: </p>
<p><em><strong>certainly </strong></em><strong>, <em>definitely, probably, undoubtedly, surely </em></strong></p>
<br>
<p>1. Adverbs of certainty go before the main verb but after the verb 'to be': </p>
<ul>
  <li>He <em><strong>definitely </strong></em>left the house this morning. </li>
  <li>He is <em><strong>probably </strong></em>in the park. </li>
</ul>
<p>2. With other auxiliary verb, these adverbs go between the auxiliary and the main verb: </p>
<ul>
  <li>He has <em><strong>certainly </strong></em>forgotten the meeting. </li>
  <li>He will <em><strong>probably </strong></em>remember tomorrow. </li>
</ul>
<p>3. Sometimes these adverbs can be placed at the beginning of the sentence: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Undoubtedly </strong></em>, Winston Churchill was a great politician. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>BE CAREFUL! with <strong><em>surely. </em></strong>When it is placed at the beginning of the sentence, it means the speaker thinks something is true, but is looking for confirmation: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Surely </strong></em>you've got a bicycle? </li>
</ul>
