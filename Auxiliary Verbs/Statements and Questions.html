<h3><font  color="Purple"><b>Negative Statements and Questions</b></font></h3>
<p>In many languages, changing a statement to a question is as easy as changing your inflection or punctuation. In Spanish, for example, you can say, “Ella habla Inglés,” or you can ask, “¿Ella habla Inglés?” The word order does not change. In English, however, the statement is, “She speaks English,” whereas the question changes to, “Does she speak English?” English questions almost always use an auxiliary verb.</p>
<p>Negative statements in English also generally use an auxiliary verb. We can’t just say, “They liked the soup?” We have to rearrange a bit, adding in the past form of the auxiliary “do” to say, “Did they like the soup?”

</p>
<font  color="Purple"><b>Do / does / did</b></font>
<p>Do is common for forming questions and making negatives.<br>

Did is used for do and does in the past tense. Do and does is never used for the past.</p>
