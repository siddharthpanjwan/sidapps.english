<p>a) A common error is joining two sentences or two independent clauses incorrectly with an improper punctuation mark instead of using a correct punctuation mark which is the semi-colon, or using a conjunction as the following example shows. EXAMPLE: We don't have a telephone, you will have to come round to the house. The two independent clauses in the sentence are incorrectly joined by a comma.</p>

<p>We can correct the sentence in the following ways:</p>

<p> Treat the two clauses as separate sentences with the use of a full-stop (period) for each sentence.  We don't have a telephone. You will have to come round to the house.</p>

<p> We can use a coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet) to create a compound sentence.  We don't have a telephone, so you will have to come round to the house.</p>

<p> We can turn one of the two clauses into a subordinate or dependent clause.  Since we don't have a telephone, you will have to come round to the house.</p>

<p> We can use the semicolon to create a compound sentence.  We don't have a telephone; you will have to come round to the hous</p>

<p>EXAMPLE: I helped them all I could, I even brought my tools to speed up the work. (INCORRECT) I helped them all I could; I even brought my tools to speed up the work. (CORRECT) I helped them all I could and I even brought my tools to speed up the work. (CORRECT)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>b) A type of sentence error known as sentence fragment is a group of words that used together does not form a complete sentence.</p>

<p> A dependent clause is being used as a sentence.  INCORRECT: Because she was the best candidate.  INCORRECT: Since ten o'clock this morning.  CORRECT: She got the job because she was the best candidate.  CORRECT: I've been here since ten o'clock this morning.</p>

<p> The wrong form of a verb is used.  INCORRECT: He eaten his lunch just a while ago.  INCORRECT: He has showed her how to catch butterflies.  CORRECT: He ate his lunch just a while ago.  CORRECT: He has shown her how to catch butterflies.</p>

<p> c) Words and phrases should be put in their rightful places. EXAMPLES: The policeman is a very brave man who caught the thief. (INCORRECT)  The policeman who caught the thief is a very brave man. (CORRECT)</p>
