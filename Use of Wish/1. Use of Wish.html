<p align="left">Let's start off with the easy part. ' I <font color='purple'>wish</font> to' can mean the same as 'I want to' but it is much, much more formal and much, much less common. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I <font color='purple'>wish</font> to make a complaint. </li>
  <li>I <font color='purple'>wish</font> to see the manager. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You can also use '<font color='purple'>wish</font>' with a noun to 'offer good wishes'. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I <font color='purple'>wish</font> you all the best in your new job. </li>
  <li>We <font color='purple'>wish</font> you a merry Christmas. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Notice that when you want to offer good wishes using a verb, you must use 'hope ' and not '<font color='purple'>wish</font>'. </p>
<ul>
  <li>We <font color='purple'>wish</font> you the best of luck. </li>
  <li>We hope you have the best of luck. </li>
  <li>I <font color='purple'>wish</font> you a safe and pleasant journey. </li>
  <li>I hope you have a safe and pleasant journey. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">However, the main use of '<font color='purple'>wish</font>' is to say that we would like things to be different from what they are, that we have regrets about the present situation. </p>
<ul>
  <li>I <font color='purple'>wish</font> I was rich. </li>
  <li>He wishes he lived in Paris. </li>
  <li>They <font color='purple'>wish</font> they'd chosen a different leader. </li>
</ul>
