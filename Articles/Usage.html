<b><font  color="Purple">Count nouns</font></b>
<p>
You can put a number in front of a count noun. (You can make a count noun plural.)<br>
You can put both a/an and the in front of a count noun.<br>
You must put an article** in front of a singular count noun.<br>
You use a plural count noun with no article if you mean all or any of that thing.<br>
You usually use a/an with a count noun the first time you say or write that noun.<br>
You use the with count nouns:<br>
the second and subsequent times you use the noun in a piece of speech or writing<br>
when the listener knows what you are referring to (maybe because there is only one of that thing)<br>
You use an (not a) when the next word (adverb, adjective, noun) starts with a vowel sound.<br></p>

<b><font  color="Purple">Note:</font></b>
<p>The above rules apply whether there is or there is not an adjective in front of the noun.<br>
Some nouns can be either count or uncount, depending on the context and meaning:<br>
Do you have paper? I want to draw a picture. (uncount = a sheet of paper)<br>
Can you get me a paper when youâ€™re at the shop? (count = a newspaper)<br>
Uncount nouns are often preceded by phrases such as: a lot of .. (luck), a piece of .. (cake), a bottle of .. (milk), a grain of .. (rice).
<br>
* Instead of an article, the noun can also be preceded by a determiner such as this, that, some, many or my, his, our, etc
